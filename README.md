# EyeSpyJs
Ever need to find out which family member has been sneaking into the cookie jar at night, but don't have time to scan through hundreds of hours of video footage?  This project is for you!  By leveraging the magic of Microsoft's Cognitive API's, this project will scan through sequenced video frames to identify when people are present.  Over time the server will learn to distinguish between unique individuals and track activity, providing the basis for a behavioural model.

## Usage Requirements
This project is built on top of Microsoft's Cognitive REST API's, and requires a valid cognitive endpoint and matching API key in order to run.

## Disclaimers
This project is not intended to be used on video captured without the subject's express permission.  In order to stay in compliance with Microsoft's cognitive API license restrictions, this project cannot be downloaded or used by law enforcement agencies.  Don't be a creep!
